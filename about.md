title: About
---

My name is Mark McCaskey.  I like programming, math, language, and
many other things!

I speak English, Japanese, Chinese, and a little bit of Lojban.

I'm currently living in Taipei, Taiwan.

I studied computer science at George Mason university and plan to go
to graduate school in the not-too-distant future.  I'm unsure exactly
where my research interests are, but I do quite enjoy programming
language theory quite a bit.

I have done a little bit with using Lojban for computation (TODO:
links and stuff here!).

I stream programming on Twitch (hopefully more regularly soon! My
current setup in Taiwan is not very conducive to streaming).

My favorite languages are Haskell, Rust, and C.  I also like (common)
lisp, but I don't often use it these days.

Either way, you can find me on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/maoeurk) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/MarkMcCaskey).
