Hello and welcome to my blog/static website!

This is something I've been meaning to set up for years at this point
and am excited to have finally done it!

I have many plans for stuff here, from rambling and other trivialities
to educational and valuable content!  All of which will be available
under some kind of permissive license.  Exactly which license, I
haven't yet decided.

I think I will start by running ads here as a test.  I'm currently
independent and likely will be for some time into the future unless
circumstances are such that I need to find a more stable job.  So, I'd
like to experiment a bit with this kind of income... I'm personally
not a fan of ads and don't blame you, dear reader, for blocking them
or disabling JavaScript in general.

Either way, I hope this is the beginning of something good!
