This is a collection of some of the things that I'm doing and have done.


## [Rusty boy](https://github.com/MarkMcCaskey/rusty-boy)

A Gameboy emulator and related tools written in Rust.  Includes an
ncurses-based interactive debugger with it's own little debugging
language, a memory visualization system, and assembler/disassembler.

This is nearing its initial release (version 0.1.0) but has been
delayed quite a bit by my move to Taiwan.

This was made live on Twitch!  It would not have been possible without
the support and help of my viewers.  Thank you!


## [Semantic Lojban for Computation](https://github.com/MarkMcCaskey/lo-vegadri)

This project is as incomplete as I am passionate about it.  The idea
was to create a language-based way of interacting with code and other
structured computer data.  This deserves multiple blog posts just to
talk about, and when I write them I'll link them here.

For now,
[here's](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6-rxSGBUkqTVjQ5anB6R0tLY2s)
a link to the paper I wrote at the last minute about it.  The paper
could be improved considerably -- I ran out of time while writing it
but it is the most complete description of the project that I exists.

I'm planning to make a full implementation/design/explanation, but the
task is massive and my own ignorance is a huge limiting factor.
Additionally, even if I knew more than I did, actually _doing_ it
would still take years of full time (or more than full time) work.  So
if you're interested in helping out, I'd love to collaborate! 


## Other

I've done quite a few other things, but I don't find many of them to
be particularly interesting at the present moment.  Instead of digging
them back up I'd rather make new, more exciting things to put here!
